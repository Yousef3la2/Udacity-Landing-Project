# Landing Page Project

This is my first project, and I desire to achieve success in the usage of the gear that I discovered to put in force what's required of me on this project.

## Table of what I did in this project

* I made some changes in the HTML and CSS file.

* I have added the sections via JavaScript.

* I created a function to create a link for each section with the navbar.

* I have added an active state to the navigation elements when the section is in the viewport.

* I have highlighted the referred section in navbar.

* I made a button to create additional sections.

* I made a button to remove the last sections.

* I made smooth scrolling with CSS.

* I made an icon to go to the top of the page.
